# Social Impact Tracker

A nonprofit analytics system designed to collect, optimize, and evaluate program-level data to generate measurable impact insights.

## Overview

Many nonprofit organizations struggle with unstructured data, redundant storage, and unclear performance evaluation metrics. The Social Impact Tracker addresses these challenges by providing a structured platform to input program data and automatically compute meaningful impact metrics. The system features built-in data compression techniques, automated analytics, and an interactive dashboard for real-time insights.

This lightweight, scalable solution is specifically designed for small to medium-sized nonprofits seeking to make data-driven decisions and clearly demonstrate their social impact.

## Key Features

### Program Data Management

Comprehensive program record management with structured data entry:

- **Program Name** - Unique identifier for each initiative
- **Time Period** - Duration or timeframe of program operation
- **Number of Beneficiaries** - People served by the program
- **Cost Incurred** - Operational expenses
- **Pre-Outcome Score** - Baseline metrics before program intervention
- **Post-Outcome Score** - Results after program completion

All data is stored in a relational database with full CRUD operations.

### Basic Data Compression Layer

Optimized data storage to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency:

- **Dictionary Encoding** - Compresses repeated program identifiers
- **Delta Encoding** - Efficiently stores time-series beneficiary growth data
- **Automated Compression** - Applied transparently during data storage
- **Reduced Storage Footprint** - Minimizes database size without loss of information

### Impact Metrics Engine

Automatic computation of key performance indicators:

| Metric | Formula | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Outcome Improvement** | Post-Outcome – Pre-Outcome | Measures program effectiveness |
| **Cost per Beneficiary** | Cost / Beneficiaries | Evaluates resource efficiency |
| **Growth Rate** | (Current – Previous) / Previous | Tracks program expansion |
| **Composite Impact Score** | Weighted formula combining all metrics | Overall program ranking |

All metrics are calculated automatically upon data entry and updated in real-time.

### Interactive Dashboard

Professional data visualization for quick insights:

- **Summary Statistics**
  - Total number of programs
  - Total beneficiaries served
  - Average impact score across all programs

- **Trend Visualizations**
  - Line chart showing beneficiary growth over time
  - Bar chart comparing cost vs. outcome improvement
  - Program ranking table sorted by impact score

- **Real-Time Updates** - Dashboard refreshes automatically with new data

### API-Based Data Flow

RESTful API architecture for flexible integration:

- `POST /programs` - Submit new program data
- `GET /programs` - Retrieve all programs
- `GET /programs/{id}` - Get specific program details
- `GET /metrics/{id}` - Calculate metrics for a program
- `GET /analytics` - Retrieve aggregated analytics

Clean separation between frontend and backend enables future integrations.

### Data Validation

Robust validation ensures data integrity:

- Prevents negative or zero values for beneficiaries and costs
- Validates outcome score consistency (post-outcome ≥ pre-outcome when expected)
- Enforces required field completion
- Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs
- Maintains referential integrity in the database
